Gemini-powered resume analysis agent using agno.

Inputs:
- resume_text: str (required)
- job_title: str (required)
- job_description_text: Optional[str]
- job_description_url: Optional[str]

Capabilities:
- If job_description_url is provided (or only job_title), uses web search tool to fetch JD context.
- Combines instructions + resume + JD to generate a Markdown report.

Note: This agent focuses on prompt design and orchestration.
Core PDF parsing and validation remain in FastAPI layer.
